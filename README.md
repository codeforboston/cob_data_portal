City of Boston Data Portal Exploration
===============

The City of Boston feels that their Socrata open data portal is difficult to use for both developers and citizens. They have asked us to investigate the portal for usability, and to make recommendations for improvement. For the first phase, we will create several small-scale app experiments to evaluate ease of development. Additional phases may follow based on Brigade recommendations.
